La télé, c'est comme l'agonie, mais en mieux...


Mes frères, Mes soeurs, écoutez-moi! Prenez vos trompettes, vos harpes, vos violoncelles! Prêtez-moi vis vies, et préparez-vous à la fin...

“Be yourself, don't take anything from anyone, and never let them take you alive.”

“If you look in the mirror and don't like what you see, you can find out first hand what it's like to be me.”

“Hey, girls, you're beautiful. Don't look at those stupid magazines with sticklike models. Eat healthy and exercise.
That's all. Don't let anyone tell you you're not good enough. You're good enough, you are too good. Love your family with all your heart and listen to it.
You are gorgeous, whether you're a size 4 or 14. It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside, as long as you're a good person, as long as you respect others. 
I know it's been told hundreds of times before, but it's true. Hey, girls, you are beautiful.”

"I learned to see beauty in everything"


 Ouais, évidemment qu'on utilise les vampires comme un métaphore pour quelque chose d'autre, un truc plus profond que simplement le surnaturel.

 Il y a tellement de gens qui essaient de prendre le contrôle sur vous quotidiennement et dde vous voler votre âme en quelque sorte.
 
 
 " Craziest thing that happened to me was being attacked by a black bird. It pecked the shit out of my head. We were at this hotel called The Phoenix in San Francisco.
 We were leaving to go to a show the next morning and the bird just fuckin' attacked my head. And the next day Slipknot were there, there were coming in as we were leaving, and they got attacked by birds too.
